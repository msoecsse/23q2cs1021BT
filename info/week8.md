## Functional Programming (SML9)
* [x] Make use of the `Iterable.forEach()` method
* [x] Be familiar with the following methods from the `Stream` interface: `collect()`, `count()`,
      `distinct()`, `filter()`, `map()`, `max()`, `min()`, `limit()`, `skip()`, `sorted()`,
      `toArray()`, and `toList()`
