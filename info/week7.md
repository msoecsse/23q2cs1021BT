## Files and Directories (SLM)
* [x] Create a Java `Path` object and associate it with a file on disk
* [x] Determine if a file exists on disk
* [x] Determine if a Java `Path` object is associated with a file or a directory
* [x] Convert between `Path` and `File` objects
* [x] Use the `Files` class to obtain input and output streams

## Input and Output (I/O) 011
* [x] Associate a low-level input (i.e., `FileInputStream`) or output (i.e., `FileOutputStream`)
  stream with a `File` object
* [x] Describe how low-level file I/O works (i.e., reading or writing of byte data, importance
  of the sequence of data)
* [x] Describe how high-level (`DataOutputStream` and `DataInputStream`) file I/O works
  (i.e., methods for reading and writing of primitive data types, association with low-level
  stream, the importance of the sequence of data)
* [x] Explain why it is important to close a stream when file operations are complete
* [x] Use the try-with-resources construct to ensure resources are closed appropriately
* [x] Explain what the `PrintWriter` class is used for
* [x] Read text data from a file using `Scanner` objects
* [x] Use the `Files` class to read/write text files
* [x] Explain the difference between binary and text files
* [x] Describe some of the important exceptions that the java file IO classes generate
* [x] Describe how buffered streams (`BufferedOutputStream` and `BufferedInputStream`) can improve
  IO performance
