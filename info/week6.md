## Exception Handling 011
* [x] Explain how exception handling increases the robustness of software
* [x] Define exception; explain the concepts of `catch` and `throw` as they relate to exceptions
* [x] Explain why `Error` exceptions should not be caught in application code
* [x] For a given program and input condition, determine the control flow of a `try`-`catch` block
* [x] Implement a method that catches an exception thrown by a class in the Java Standard Library
* [x] Implement a method that uses a `try`-`catch` block and a repetition statement (i.e., loop) to validate user input
* [ ] Distinguish between checked and unchecked exceptions
* [ ] Explain the concept of exception propagation; explain the outcome if an exception is thrown and not caught by the program
* [ ] Explain the consequences of not handling a checked exception within a method where the checked exception occurs
* [x] Inspect a call stack trace displayed by an unhandled exception to determine what caused the exception to be thrown (covered in SLM)
* [ ] Use multiple catch blocks to customize the way different types of exceptions are handled
* [ ] Use the `throws` clause to postpone when a checked exception is handled
* [ ] For a given program and input condition, determine the control flow of a `try`-`catch` block with and without the `finally` clause
